## Features

### ü´Ä Physiological Systems Modeled
- **Cardiovascular System**: Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output
- **Respiratory System**: Breathing rate, oxygen saturation, tidal volume
- **Metabolic System**: Core temperature, metabolic rate, hydration levels
- **Neurological System**: Stress levels, alertness states

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Two Physiological States

#### Homeostasis (Resting State)
- Heart Rate: 72 bpm
- Breathing Rate: 12 breaths/min
- Core Temperature: 98.6¬∞F
- Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
- Normal metabolic and stress levels

#### Marathon Running (Extreme Exercise)
- Heart Rate: 165 bpm (2.3x increase)
- Breathing Rate: 45 breaths/min (3.75x increase)
- Core Temperature: 102.5¬∞F (elevated)
- Blood Pressure: 180/90 mmHg (elevated)
- Metabolic rate increased 18x
- High stress hormone levels

### üé® Interactive Features
- **Real-time Animations**: Heart beating, lung expansion, blood flow
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated parameter changes between states
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded systems and stress indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press '1' for homeostasis, '2' for marathon
- **Touch Support**: Swipe gestures on mobile devices

### üìä Data Visualization
- Real-time parameter displays with animated progress bars
- Anatomical SVG visualization with system highlighting
- Physiological explanations for each state
- Scientific accuracy in parameter ranges

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. **Switch States**: Click the "Homeostasis" or "Marathon Running" buttons
3. **Observe Changes**: Watch as all parameters transition smoothly
4. **Interact**: Hover over body parts, use keyboard shortcuts, or swipe on mobile

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and SVG graphics
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality and real-time animations
- **SVG**: Scalable vector graphics for the human body visualization

### Key Components
- **Physiological Data Models**: Scientifically accurate parameter ranges
- **Animation Engine**: Smooth transitions and real-time updates
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal viewing
- **Touch/Gesture Support**: Mobile-friendly interactions

## Scientific Accuracy

The physiological parameters are based on real human body responses:

- **Homeostasis values** represent typical resting adult measurements
- **Marathon values** reflect physiological responses during extreme endurance exercise
- **Transition animations** simulate the body's adaptive responses
- **System interactions** show how different body systems work together

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers with touch support
- Responsive design for screens 320px and above

## Educational Value

This visualization helps understand:
- How the human body maintains homeostasis
- Physiological responses to extreme exercise
- Interconnections between body systems
- Real-time adaptation mechanisms
- The amazing capacity of human physiology

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions could include:
- Additional physiological states (sleep, stress, illness)
- More detailed organ system visualizations
- Historical data tracking and graphing
- Educational quizzes and information panels
- Sound effects for heartbeat and breathing
- VR/AR compatibility
